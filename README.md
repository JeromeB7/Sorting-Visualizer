# Sorting-Visualizer
This is a project written in JavaScript where HTML is used as backbone and CSS for styling.
Here, the Bubble sort, the Selection sort, the Insertion sort and the Heap sort are visualised using the visualizer. 
The visualizer is created using JS canvas and styled using CSS.
The visualizer also includes sound effects that are made using webkitAudioContext.
